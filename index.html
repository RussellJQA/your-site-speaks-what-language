            <p>If you don't specify a language for your Web pages, it can confuse Screen Readers and other Assistive Technology.
                I built this demo Web site to demonstrate the problem. The site's HTML source code is available here on
                <a href='https://github.com/RussellJQA/your-site-speaks-what-language/' target='_blank' title="Opens in a new window."
                    aria-label="GitHub: Opens in a new window">GitHub</a>. This is the site's home page, and is essentially the same as <a href='https://www.russelljqa.site/blog/your-site-speaks-what-language/' target='_blank' title="Opens in a new window." aria-label="this blog post: Opens in a new window">this blog post</a>, except that it's followed by 3 demo pages:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <a href='https://russelljqa.github.io/your-site-speaks-what-language/english-no-lang.html' target='_blank' title="Opens in a new window."
                        aria-label=" English: No lang: Opens in a new window"> English: No lang</a> — This demo page is written in English. But I intentionally omitted an HTML
                    <code>lang</code> attribute. As a result, Screen Readers have to guess what language to use. An English Screen
                    Reader guesses it's in English, which in this case is right.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href='https://russelljqa.github.io/your-site-speaks-what-language/espanol-no-lang.html' target='_blank' title="Opens in a new window."
                        aria-label="Spanish: No lang: Opens in a new window">Spanish: No lang</a> — This page is a Spanish translation of the previous page. Again, I intentionally
                    omitted an HTML
                    <code>lang</code> attribute. As a result, Screen Readers still have to guess what language to use. An English
                    Screen Reader guesses it's in English, but in this case that's wrong. It pronounces the Spanish words
                    as if they were English, and reads the numbers as English.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href='https://russelljqa.github.io/your-site-speaks-what-language/espanol-lang-es.html' target='_blank' title="Opens in a new window."
                        aria-label="Spanish: lang='es': Opens in a new window">Spanish: lang='es'</a> — This Web page is identical to the previous one, except that this time, I gave
                    it an HTML
                    <code>lang</code> attribute of
                    <code>lang='es'</code>. The
                    <code>'es'</code> is for Español, which is Spanish for "Spanish". No more guessing for Screen Readers. Realizing
                    the page is in Spanish, they pronounce it as Spanish, and read the numbers as Spanish.
                </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                <a href='' target='_blank' title="Focus Order: Opens in a new window." aria-label="Opens in a new window"></a>
            </p>
            <h3>Why is using the HTML 'lang' attribute important?</h3>
            <p>Assistive Technology (AT) such as Screen Readers, Speech Synthesizers, and Braille Translators need to know what
                language a page is in, to speak or display it properly. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Web Content Accessibility
                Guidelines
                <a href='https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?versions=2.0' target='_blank' title="Focus Order: Opens in a new window."
                    aria-label="(WCAG) 2.0: Opens in a new window">(WCAG) 2.0</a>
                include the need to do this a
                <strong>Level AA</strong> guideline. (
                <strong>Level AA</strong> means a Website "must do" this to be considered accessible.) WCAG 2.0 calls this guideline
                <a href='https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/language-of-page' target='_blank' title="Opens in a new window." aria-label="Success Criterion 3.1.1: Language of Page: Opens in a new window">Success Criterion 3.1.1: Language of Page</a>. Adhering to such guidelines is a legal requirement for many
                Websites worldwide.</p>
            <p>Knowing a Web page's language is important for areas other than Accessibility as well. Some search engines let
                users restrict search results to those of a specific language. Web browsers use different default fonts depending
                upon what language content is in. They use different fonts for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean than those they
                use for English. Spelling and grammar checkers need to know what language content is in, as do translation
                services. For more information, see the following 2 World Wide Web Consortium's articles on Internationalization:
                <a href='https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-lang-why' target='_blank' title="Opens in a new window." aria-label="Why use the language attribute?: Opens in a new window">Why use the language attribute?</a>
                and
                <a href='https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-css-lang' target='_blank' title="Opens in a new window." aria-label="Styling using language attributes: Opens in a new window">Styling using language attributes</a>.</p>
            <h3>You can see and hear the importance of this first-hand</h3>
            <p>One of the best ways of doing so is with a Screen Reader.
                <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Narrator' target='_blank' title="Opens in a new window." aria-label="Microsoft Narrator: Opens in a new window">Microsoft Narrator</a>
                comes free with Windows, and
                <a href='https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/chromevox/kgejglhpjiefppelpmljglcjbhoiplfn?hl=en' target='_blank' title="Opens in a new window."
                    aria-label="ChromeVox: Opens in a new window">ChromeVox</a>
                is a free extension for Google Chrome. But neither is a full featured Screen Reader, and the announcing in both seems unaffected
                by the HTML language attribute.
                <a href='https://www.nvaccess.org' target='_blank' title="Opens in a new window." aria-label="NVDA: Opens in a new window">NVDA</a>
                (NonVisual Desktop Access), on the other hand, is a free, full featured Windows Screen Reader which handles this correctly.
                NVDA works best with Mozilla Firefox, so the following video uses NVDA with Firefox, on a "U.S. English"
                version of Windows (8.1), with NVDA's language set to "English".</p>
            <p>
                <h4 id='video' tabindex='0'>Video</h4>
            </p>
            <video controls style='width:100%; max-width:1366px' title="your-site-speaks-what-language Demo Web site, with the language of NVDA set to English">
                <source src='your-site-speaks-what-language.mp4' type='video/mp4'>
                <img src='your-site-speaks-what-language.png' style='width:100%; max-width:852px' alt="your-site-speaks-what-language Demo Web site, with the language of NVDA set to English">

            <p>
                <br>
            </p>
            <h3>How do you use the 'lang' attribute?</h3>
            <p>It's easy to specify what language your Web page is written in. Just add the
                <code>lang</code> attribute, with the appropriate language code, to the end of your initial
                <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag. For example, to specify English as the language of your Web page, you simply replace:</p>
            <p>
                <blockquote>
                    &lt;html&gt;
                </blockquote>
                with:</p>
            <p>
                <blockquote>
                    &lt;html lang='en'&gt;
                </blockquote>
                For languages other than English, see the ISO 639-1 Codes listed in the U.S. Library of Congress's
                <a href='https://www.loc.gov/standards/iso639-2/php/code_list.php' target='_blank' title="Opens in a new window." aria-label="Codes for the Representation of Names of Languages: Opens in a new window">Codes for the Representation of Names of Languages</a>

            <h3>What if just some of your Web Page is in a different language?</h3>
            <p>
                The W3C's WCAG 2.0 Guidelines include a
                <strong>Level AA</strong> ("should have") guideline for this. It's
                <a href='https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/language-of-parts' target='_blank' title="Opens in a new window." aria-label="Success Criterion 3.1.2: Language of Parts: Opens in a new window">Success Criterion 3.1.2: Language of Parts</a>. Adhering to
                <em>AA</em> guidelines is also a legal requirement for many Websites worldwide. The details of the
                <em>Language of Parts</em> guideline are beyond the scope of this blog post. But you can read more about it in
